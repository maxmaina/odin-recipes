            <h1>Chicken Alfredo</h1>
            <img src="chicken-alfredo.jpg" alt="Dish">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chicken alfredo is a classic favorite—a creamy white sauce, 
                long strands of pasta mixed with tender pieces of lean protein. 
                For this recipe, I cut the meat for quicker cooking and use a 
                generous amount of seasonings for maximum flavor.
            </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
                <li>4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>¼ cup water</li>
                <li>1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, pressed</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
                <li>1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped canned mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spray the crock of a slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. 
                    Place chicken breasts in the crock. Combine water and Italian dressing mix in a small bowl. 
                    Pour over chicken; sprinkle with garlic, cover, and cook on Low for 4 hours.</li>
                <li>After 4 hours, whisk cream cheese and condensed soup together in a bowl. 
                    Pour over chicken. Stir in mushrooms. Cover and cook on Low for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. 
                    Stir in spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
                    until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well.</li>
                <li>To serve, spoon chicken and sauce over hot cooked pasta and sprinkle with parsley.</li>
            </ol>
