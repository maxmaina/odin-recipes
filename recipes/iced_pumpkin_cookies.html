                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li><strong>icing</strong></li>
                <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.</li>
                <li>To make the cookies: Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, 
                    nutmeg, cloves, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Cream together sugar and butter in a mixing bowl until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                    Add pumpkin, egg, and vanilla; beat until creamy. Mix in flour mixture until combined.
                     Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets; flatten slightly.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until centers are set, 15 to 20 minutes, switching racks halfway through. 
                    Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the icing: Stir together confectioners' sugar, milk, butter, 
                    and vanilla in a bowl until smooth. Add milk as needed, to achieve drizzling consistency.</li>
                <li>Drizzle icing over cooled cookies with a fork.</li>
            </ol>
